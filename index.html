        <p>Jennie Qu-Lee's research interests expand from psychological and neuro-cognitive mechanisms of motivational biases in visual and social perception to intergroup decision-making. More specifically, she is interested in how we characterize the dynamic processes by which we perceive, understand, make decisions about people like us and those who are not, and navigate the social world. She utilizes a multi-level approach to advance her understanding of <i>intergroup dynamics</i>, and hopes to build long-lasting interventions to combat <i>group-based discrimination</i>.</p>
        <p>She is pursuing her PhD candidacy at <em>New York University</em> (advisor: Dr. <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/balcetis/">Emily Balcetis</a>), after working as a social neuroscience lab manager for Dr. <a href="http://www.mendesiedleckilab.com/">Peter Mende-Siedlecki</a> at <em>the University of Delaware</em> for two years. She received her MA from <em>the University of Chicago</em> and her BS from <em>Fudan University</em>.</p>
